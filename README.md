# duckduckgo-translate
This is the DuckDuckGo Translation library that handles translation tokens sent from the Duck.co website. This library also helps DDG and the community translate DuckDuckGo micro-sites and other services.

This has been purpose-built for DuckDuckGo, it is not intended for general use.
